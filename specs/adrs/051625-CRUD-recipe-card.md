# CRUD Recipe Card


---

## Context & Goals

We need to have:

* Appealing Card Design
* Easy to expand to full information on the card
* Card flips to the back side to present information

---

## Considered Options

|   #   | Option                                                | Summary                                                                                                            |
| :---: | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|   1   | ** Wood-grained realistic/ rustic design.             |  "Coffee" / age-based design of card*         
|   2   | ** Modern, Bright Card**                              | Card based on using fall colors, and focuses on more cartoony/simple design choices rather than                                                                        realistic

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option: 2 – Modern, Bright Card **

This decision gave a lot of depth to how 

### Key Advantages

* Much more appealing to the eyes
* Freedom to choose a variety of colors and design choices rather than looking to find specific textures
* Matches the initial design of the home page

*Why not Option 1?*   
- Most of the group disliked the design
- Looked outdated, fit the design philosophy of the late 2000s/early 2010s more
- Most of the group disliked the design

## Consequences

* **Good** –  Cards were more liked and visually appealing
* **Good** – More room to add information to cards, as there was no need to worry about writing on textures
* **Trade-off** – Could make our card look a lot more basic and less detailed
* ** Bad** - Would make to redesign the card UI from the ground up again, taking valuable time
