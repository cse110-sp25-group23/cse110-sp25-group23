# Recipe Card CRUD and Design

## Create 

We plan on having a "Create Card" section, which allows the users to:
- Name the card
- Add the ingredients
- Add an image for their card
- Add the tags they want to associate with their card
- Add the cooking steps they want to note down for their recipe.

It will look something like this (NOTE: this is the rough HTML mockup/outline of how it is going to appear):

*NOTE: The Create part of the Recipe Card ended up expanding into a complete page with its own individual aspects/features. Look to 060925-create-recipe-card for more info.* 

## Read 

Users will be able to view all of their recipes in a "My Recipes" section of the site, which we currently have planned will list out all their recipes on a shelf design of some sort.

Here is the finalized version of the "My Recipes" page. We ended up keeping that general shelf look while still adding our own "flair" into it.

For viewing a card, the current design plan we have for it follows this structure when the user clicks the card:

Our final version contains a lot of the ideals we had in the design plan, with some things changed, like adding an image to our card, and flipping the card to read out the instructions instead.

## Update

In this shelfing section, users will be prompted whether or not they want to view, edit, or delete their recipe.

Editing a card should follow a similar structure to how the "Create Card" section looks, or in other words, we can redirect them to that section, just with the title changed from "Create Card" to "Edit Card".

These features are seen in the finalized version where users can view the card in full screen, or edit, or delete it.

This is what it looks like when the user wants to update the card with whatever information they want to change.

## Delete

For deleting the card, we can prompt the user whether or not they want to delete the card, something along the lines of this:

DELETE UPDATE: In the finalized version of our site, we ended up having the delete be instantaneous rather than prompting the user with a warning. We also added the feature where if one shelf for a category is now empty completely, it would disappear entirely.
