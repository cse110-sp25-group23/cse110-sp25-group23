# Recipe Card CRUD and Design

## Create 

We plan on having a "Create Card" section, which allows the users to:
- Name the card
- Add the ingredients
- Add an image for their card
- Add the tags they want to associate with their card
- Add the cooking steps they want to note down for their recipe.

It will look something like this (NOTE: this is the rough HTML mockup/outline of how it is going to appear):

## Read 

Users will be able to view all of their recipes in a "My Recipes" section of the site, which we currently have planned will list out all their recipes on a shelf design of some sort.

For viewing a card, the current design plan we have for it follows this structure when the user clicks the card:

## Update

In this shelfing section, users will be prompted whether or not they want to view, edit, or delete their recipe.

Editing a card should follow a similar structure to how the "Create Card" section looks, or in other words, we can redirect them to that section, just with the title changed from "Create Card" to "Edit Card".

## Delete
For deleting the card, we can prompt the user whether or not they want to delete the card, something along the lines of this:
