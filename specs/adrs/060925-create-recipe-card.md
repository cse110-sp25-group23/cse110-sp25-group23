## Considered Options

|   #   | Option                                                | Summary                                                                                                            |

|   1   | **Add-on to "My Recipes".                              |  Simple create page gets shown*         
|   2   | **Full Create Recipe Site**                           |  Creation Site with appealing UI, Meal Planner, and Search Recipe Functionality

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option: 2 – Full Create Recipe Site **

This decision gave a lot of depth to how 

### Key Advantages

* ** More depth and features could be explored by making a new site
* **Meal Planner option allows users to make food schedules to go back to constantly

*Why not Option 1?*   
– It was a lot less creative and limited the features of our site
– "Too Simple" in Design

---

## Consequences

* **Good** –  Other features such as Meal Planner and Searching Recipes took advantage of the full site
* **Good** – A lot more intuitive and in-depth for users to explore and create
* **Trade-off** – There is a bit of overlap between some Nav Bar features 
* **Bad** – Would take a lot more time to develop and debug
