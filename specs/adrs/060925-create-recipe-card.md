# Create Recipe Card

## Design

The design for the "Create Recipe Card" page expanded from a small section originally in "My Recipes" into its own full site. There are 3 main sections. 

1. Create a Recipe Card!
2. Meal Planner
3. Search for a Specific Recipe

## Create a Recipe Card!

This Section is where users input the information they want into their Recipe Card.

To start off, users can but in the recipe name, the author, the image of the food, Tags, and ingredients of the food.

Users then can list the steps on producing the food, and how long it takes them to make it.

Then, once "Create Recipe" is clicked, it appears on the rightmost side of the screen to show off to the user.

## Meal Planner:

The meal planner can group the recipes into a specific category. For example, if I click "Create Meal", it shows checkboxes to group a recipe to a specific meal.

And when I click "Save Meal", it shows up as a created meal.

And the meal items appear in the third section, the search section. Note only the items in the specific meal will show up in this section now
