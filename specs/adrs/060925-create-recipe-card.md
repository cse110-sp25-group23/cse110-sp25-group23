# Create Recipe Card

## Design

The design for the "Create Recipe Card" page expanded from a small section originally in "My Recipes" into its own full site. There are 3 main sections. 

1. Create a Recipe Card!
2. Meal Planner
3. Search for a Specific Recipe

## Create a Recipe Card!

This Section is where users input the information they want into their Recipe Card.

To start off, users can but in the recipe name, the author, the image of the food, Tags, and ingredients of the food.

Users then can list the steps on producing the food, and how long it takes them to make it.

Then, once "Create Recipe" is clicked, it appears on the rightmost side of the screen to show off to the user.

## Meal Planner:

The meal planner can group the recipes into a specific category. For example, if I click "Create Meal", it shows checkboxes to group a recipe to a specific meal.

And when I click "Save Meal", it shows up as a created meal.

And the meal items appear in the third section, the search section. Note only the items in the specific meal will show up in this section now

#  Create Recipe Card

---

## Context & Goals

We need to support:

* Newly made cards appearing on the shelf
* Easy to understand and input information
* Design

---

## Considered Options

|   #   | Option                                                | Summary                                                                                                            |
| :---: | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|   1   | **Add-on to "My Recipes".                              |  Simple create page gets shown*         
|   2   | **Full Create Recipe Site**                           |  Creation Site with appealing UI, Meal Planner, and Search Recipe Functionality

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option: 2 – Full Create Recipe Site **

This decision gave a lot of depth to how 

### Key Advantages

* ** More depth and features could be explored by making a new site
* **Meal Planner option allows users to make food schedules to go back to constantly

*Why not Option 1?*   
– It was a lot less creative and limited the features of our site
– "Too Simple" in Design

---

## Consequences

* **Good** –  Other features such as Meal Planner and Searching Recipes took advantage of the full site
* **Good** – A lot more intuitive and in-depth for users to explore and create
* **Trade-off** – There is a bit of overlap between some Nav Bar features 
* **Bad** – Would take a lot more time to develop and debug
