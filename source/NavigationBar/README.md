# Nav-bar Feature
Contributors: Fnu Anu

Note: The main file here is nav-bar.html, nav-bar.css and nav-bar.js (yet to be implemented). 
Additional Folders: Images folder contains icons for mobile navigation bar to 
facilitate smaller screen sizes and website logo. 

**Context:** The purpose of this page is to facilitate the replication of navbar and footer across various
web pages so the updates to the structure are formulated here for further manipulations, as changes are made.

**Instructions:** Please copy the css and html sections (correctly use it as sections within your pages)
and be careful to not override any of the functionality by any of the other css parts you may have worked on!

**Main functionalities or points to consider:**
- The search bar functionality is really important for the user to be able to navigate to a recipe that they would like to dircetly go to instead of browsing if they would like to.
- The footer and navbar helps with accessibility as we adopted ARIA standards as part of an ADR and easier navigation to various pages for the user's convenience.

Note: Navigation Bar will be uniform after being developed and integrated by me on all pages across this project website!
