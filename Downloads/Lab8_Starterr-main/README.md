## Graceful Degradation and Service Workers

Service workers contribute to graceful degradation by enabling web applications to function even when offline or on a poor network connection. By caching essential assets and intercepting network requests, service workers ensure that the application remains usable, albeit potentially with reduced functionality (e.g., showing cached data instead of real-time updates), rather than failing completely. This allows the application to degrade gracefully in the absence of a reliable network.
