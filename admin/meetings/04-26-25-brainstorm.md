## Project Ideas

During our brainstorming efforts, two ideas really stuck with the team

1. Recipe Card Idea
- Create cards which contain recipes
  - Upon creating a card, you will be able to add steps, ingredients and a picture and your card will be added to your collection
  - Users will be able to add tags to their recipes and those tags will be used to search and sort for recipes
  - Shopping list to add ingredients to cart and price per serving
  - Perhaps nutritional facts
- Create meals using different recipe cards
1. Card Collection Game
- Get in game currency passively or using real money
- Cards themselves can generate in game currency and you can use that to buy more packs with more cards
- You can add them to an 'aquarium' which is a card collection
- This aquarium will have different decorations and themes and only a certain number or cards can go in to generate currency
- Store to buy sell and trade cards

Some of our members were not able to attend in person so ideas were communicated to them and they did their own research and voting
