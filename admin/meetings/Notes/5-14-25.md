### Agenda - Plan Our First Sprint

- Branching Strategy: Devanshi advised us to impliment this branching strategy
  - We will all have our own feature branches where we will work on our respective features and once it is complete, we will create a pull request to merge with the ` staging ` branch. In order to prevent conflicting code from making it to production (for exmaple tests not working together) we will only make a pull request to the `main` branch at the end of the sprint.
  - To prevent merge conflicts in the `staging` and `main` branches please communicate if you need to modify code in another feature and try to rebase.
