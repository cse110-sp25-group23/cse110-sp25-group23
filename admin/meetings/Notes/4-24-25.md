# Meeting 4-24-25

## Before we start
- Congrats everyone, we were the best out of Devanshi's groups and we got extra credit :partying_face: !

- Feeback:
  - During the meeting with our TA, Devanshi, we recieved feedback on our project
    -  Altough it was fine for the warmup assignment, for the class project we shouldnt have different teams doing the same thing. (we were not planning on it)
    -  Presentation does matter. Again, Subway Surfer audio was fine for the warmup however, having a professional voiceover expaining your product to a customer is the objective.
    -  Proper README.md page with documentation on features and progress

-  Preview:
   -  We will need to have meetings for each sprint we do
      -  This meeting will include progress on what was done or what was not done
         -  Its ok if life gets in the way and you are not able to contribute much, try to catch up and make sure to communicate with TA and team
   - Features will be implimented by individuals or team, regardless, each person will have their own branch they will push to
   - These Feature Branches will have all their work done there, once the feature is complete, the team member will create a pull request and then someone will review it
     - Consider types of review:
       -  Lead Review where Sarah and Luis or designated Reviewers will review
       -  Peer Review where everyone will have to review someone else's pull requests
    -  On this note we need to set expectations on standards for testing, documentation, coding style, ect.
    -  We are strongly encouraged to use Github Board to monitor and document process (if someone has a different suggestion let us know)

- Meetings:
  - This assignment is pretty large so we are breaking it up, please fill out the [when2meet](https://www.when2meet.com/?30281416-4ScIa) so far it is looking like friday 7-8pm
  - How does team feel about in-person vs online meetings?
    - Please message Luis or Sarah stating your preference and how strong your position is, once everyone resonds we will make an announcement 
      - Strongly Lean, Slightly Lean, No preference for in person/online
