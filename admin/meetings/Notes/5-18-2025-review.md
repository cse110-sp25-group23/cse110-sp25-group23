## **Agenda**
Hold a quick sprint review meeting where every team goes through the work they did the past week and demos it (so everyone gets a good idea where things are at).

## **Review Meeting:**
- Every team demoâ€™d their progress. Looked at initial home page, CRUD pages for creating/updating/removing recipe cards, local storage, calendar page, and CI/CD pipeline.
+ Research/ADR done on importing recipes along with a quick demo. Will need to check with the recipe-card or local-storage team to ensure we store the data properly after importing.
+ Research/ADR also done on the shopping cart page (adding ingredients and so on). This will likely be implemented with localstorage as well.
* Discussed possibilities for future recipe-card template improvement (ex: if we wanted to make it a flippable card or not, and how we might implement that).

## **Next Action Items:**
1. Some improvements to be made for each feature (ex: styling, recipe card template). Also need to begin code implementations for shopping-cart and recipe-importing.
2. Need to think about how to update features to work with future implementations and changes. For example, we might need to expand local-storage to work with the shopping cart implementation and with any changes to the recipe-card template.

## **Tasks Assigned List:**
- None yet (TBD)
