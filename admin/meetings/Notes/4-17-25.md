## How to divide work
### Team or Individual: 
Teams of 1-3, as to break up the work efficiently, allowing those with difficult schedules to work on their own time.

### Code Review:
At least one person from each team should try to meet on Sunday. The time is still being decided using the [when2meet link](https://www.when2meet.com/?30193740-rL7eL)

### Group Meeting Ideas: 
We want to have future meetings during the week and one during the weekend and try to get everyone to attend one meeting per week if possble.\
Meetings in the beginning of the week should be used to plan these weekly assignments since they are due Sunday night, this gives everyone an opportunity to plan out their schedule.
