## **Agenda** - * Review individual and team progress on integration and testing, finalize sprint features, check pipeline and automation status*

## **Progress Updates:**
1. Anu implemented nav bar, footer, search bar, and integrated multiple functionalities including calendar, cart, and favorites. Debugged across team code.
2. Anna debugged calendar toggle logic and wrote unit and E2E tests for calendar.js functions.
3. Kelvin and Niroop finalized shelf design and responsive layout. Implemented scrolling, card rendering logic, and tag shelf integration.
4. Zoey updated CSS for cards, added responsive behaviors, animation, and started unit testing.
5. Thanh revamped meal groupings using tags, cleaned up storage logic, and implemented search functionality.
6. Mehdi continued testing import functionality, improved error handling, and integrated with Anu's calendar view.
7. Rain and Felicia demonstrated pipeline setup and execution using Playwright and Docker. Explained config for e2e and unit testing.
8. Manan completed unit and e2e tests for shopping cart using Jest and Cypress.

*What worked/what did not worked well?*
- Integration between members (e.g., Anu and Anna, Anu and Mehdi) worked well.
- UI responsiveness and visual consistency showed progress.
- Some challenges remained in debugging local storage syncing and setting up automated pipeline correctly for all branches.
   
## **Topics Discussed:**
- Anu's integration work for calendar, cart, and favorites
- Anna's unit tests for calendar and toggle logic
- Shelf design responsiveness and JavaScript logic (Kelvin, Niroop)
- Zoey's card UI fixes, toggle/fullscreen UI, and scrollable tag UX
- Thanh's use of tag-based meal groupings and container simplification
- Mehdi and Anu's import integration and error handling
- Rain's pipeline demo and Playwright e2e config
- Manan's Jest and Cypress testing for shopping cart

## **Review/Retrospect Meeting:**
- Integration across modules is more cohesive than last sprint
- Several UI/UX issues resolved, but more unit testing still needed
- Playwright pipeline works reliably for test execution


## **Next Action Items:**
1. Finalize unit tests for all new features (Zoey, Mehdi, Thanh)
2. Fix bugs with local storage sync for calendar and import (Anna, Anu)
3. Demo pipeline to TA with finalized configuration (Rain, Felicia)

## **Tasks Assigned List:**
- Write missing unit tests for import feature (assigned to Mehdi)
- Complete UI edge case testing for shelf responsiveness (assigned to Zoey)
- Debug calendar e2e failures and update test runner config (assigned to Anna)
