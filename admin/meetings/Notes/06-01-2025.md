## **Progress Updates:**

1. **Thanh**: Rebuilt group meal feature to match updated recipe cards (add/delete recipes works). Working on edit functionality and unit testing. Accessibility work (ARIA tags) is pending.
2. **Manan**: Integrated shopping cart with recipe cards, including “Buy Ingredients” to Instacart functionality. Needs to write unit and Jest tests.
3. **Sarah**: Styled recipe card form; shopping cart page styling pending due to theme alignment.
4. **Luis**: Continued work on recipe import feature (using URLs from outside sites to auto-generate recipe cards).
5. **Niroop**: Built out "My Recipes" UI based on Kelvin’s design, adding category shelves with "See All" buttons. Need to work on "Favorites" button.
6. **Kelvin**: Created the initial shelf layout for recipes, planning to redesign shelf visuals and support dynamic shelf growth. Balancing with a midterm exam.
7. **Rain**: Worked on CI/CD pipeline, faced permission issues, rolled back and restarted. Focus is now on completing unit testing; played with integration and end-to-end tests. Also worked on ADRs and repo artifacts.
8. **Felicia**: Started on end-to-end testing using Playwright; current test confirms card renders and navigation works.
9. **Anu**: Rebuilt homepage layout with new cart summary, scheduled meals, and favorite recipes. Pulled from localStorage. Waiting on feedback before finalizing.
10. **Anna**: Reported limited progress, but plans to update homepage by Wednesday.
