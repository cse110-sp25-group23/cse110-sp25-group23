## Planned 
- Felicia researched [End-to-End testing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K5G9X4HYc8mXMNajMHfCcMMuPmtW0Buk06Oc_Wxf39Y/edit?tab=t.0) and can integrate into Github once workflow is up.
  - Anu is planning to implement Cypress tests for end-to-end testing once the website is more functional for all checks from a user's perspective of running through various pages.
+ Zoey and Anna researched [Documentation generation via automation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16DxRgmR27evrYpejO6OraAx11qEy7x7xjtEnA3CR2Tg/edit?tab=t.0).
