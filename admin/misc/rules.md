- Divide code development by feature (features include)
  - MVP/CRUD
  - Homepage
  - Weekly Meal log
  - Grocery Shopping List
  - Documentation and testing

## Potential Issues
Scheduling has been an issue. As midterms and finals do take up a lot of time, please proactively communicate when you will be occupied by these tests so the team can accommodate. 
## Rules are not being Followed
- If a team member notices that another team member is not communicating or participating, then they will talk to the leads and the leads will communicate with the team member
- Have a group discussion to revise the group contract if needed
## Communication Protocols
-If something comes up and you cannot work on the group assignment or make it to group meetings, message a TA and/or a lead
- Meeting format 
  - one online, one in-person per week
  - Weekly Sprint meets at 4pm on Wednesday must be attended. These meetings are online.
- Post meeting notes in Slack announcements after each meeting 
- Announce to rest of feature-group through Slack when committing to GitHub branch and creating a pull request
- Work will be assigned using Github Issues during Sprint meetings using an issue backlog
